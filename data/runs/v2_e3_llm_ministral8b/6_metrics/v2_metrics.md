# v2 metrics (protocol v2.0)

478 scored conditions over 50 seeds. Rates are percentages: `rate [95% cluster-bootstrap CI]`, with `(sensitivity bounds)` where ambiguous, unjudged or errored conditions exist. Results are reported per attack distribution, never pooled (model.md §9).

## Attack source: gemma
